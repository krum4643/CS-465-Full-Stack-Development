# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development

Architecture

In my fullstack project I created throughout this course, the Express HTML and JavaScript frontend provided a very basic multiple page structure, while the Angular SPA offered something a bit smoother and faster for the users by updating content dynamically without needing to relouad the page completely. The backend used a MongoDB database to allow for very flexible data storage using JSON documents which in turn made it very easy to manage the unstructerd data we were creating.

Functionality

JSON is very lightweight when it comes to data formatting and is used to exchange info between the frontend and backend, while JavaScript is the programming language that allows us to manipulate this data. During the development, I refactored code that was repetitive into UI components that are reusable which helped me to improve the efficiency of my application and made it easier to maintain

Testing

API testing required multiple methods including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, as well as ensuring that endpoints were returning accurate responses based on what I was expecting. Adding in authentication was very difficult at first, but it helped me greater understand the need to protect the data using token-based security and authroization within this application.

Reflection

This course has helped me realize everything it takes to develop using a MEAN fullstack procedure including frontend design, backend lofgic, and the integration of multiple APIs. I have gained a massive amount of experience with frameworks, databases, and the deployment of these applications. Ultimately this course has made me a stronger candidate for web and software development careers in my future.
